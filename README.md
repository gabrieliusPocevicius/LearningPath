 This repository delves into a more statistical learning approach.

We have Algorithms, large tech giant demands and statistics of what they need and what software engineers,
front-end developers need to know and learn.
We want people to become informed about Algorithms that can get you an edge in the tech industry.
We provide a new way of Learning coding with examples available about every Algorithm. 
We want people to join and work together to make this site even better this better and larger.
Any code contributions are welcome and needed.
